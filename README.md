Modeling Flights Delay and Cancellation Based On Flight Information And Weather Data

## Purpose of this research
As per a study done by researchers in 2010 at University of California, Berkeley, the domestic flight delays cost puts a $33 billion dent into the US economy and about half of that cost is borne by the passengers. With accurate data readily available, I decided to model flight delays using flight and weather data. I tried to predict flight delays, cancellation and length of delay. I hope my research will alleviate some of the costs caused by domestic flight delays. 

## Goal of this my study
* Goal 1: Based on flight information (flight, airline, time, origin, destination etc.) and weather features (temp, humidity, rain, precipitation, snow, snow depth, wind speed etc.), I will build a model which will predict if the flight is going to be delayed (more than 15 mins) or not.
* Goal 2: I will also run a regression model to predict by how much the flight will be delayed.
* Goal 3: Finally, I will model and predict whether or not a flight will be cancelled due to weather.
